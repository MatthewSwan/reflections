====== Git Pairing ======

Branches allow separate users to upload different versions of code
with separate histories. Github is able to merge these branches together
so that all code base is within one project.

One person will initialize the master branch and they will be called
"Host". "Pairs" will have accesss to the master branch on github cloning
the host's repository.

Pairs can view the master branch: "git checkout master"
Continually check the status of code by typing "git status" or "gs"
Getting the latest version of master code: "git pull (address of master)"
  This allows branch masters to work on the latest code
Creating a new branch (verify you are doing this from the master repo:
  "git checkout -b (branch name)"
Pushing a branch to github: "git push -u origin (branch name)"
You will then go to github and and 'pull' the branch to the master
It there are not any problems with the code: merge the branched
  code with the master
Check out the master branch to verify the branched code has been set in
  place: "git checkout master"
Pull the new changes from the master: "git pull"
