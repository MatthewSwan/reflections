If you do not have early success in something, that doesn't mean you cannot be great at it.
Actually, failures tend to make you learn better and they keep you working harder and harder to achieve your goals.
If you are told at an early stage that you are great at something, you may become complacent.
Keep reaching for the stars and good things will come!
