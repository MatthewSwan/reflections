tip-01 - Stare at who you want to become

"Fill you windshield with vivid images of your future self, and
stare at them everyday"

Reflect on watching Josh zoom through VIM and mentor meetings.
Surround yourself with role models and this can unconsciously
increase motivation.

"If he/she can do it, why can't I?"

You can pick up 'shortcuts' and learn a great deal by surrounding
yourself with people who you would like to become. Just watching them
will stimulate your brain and open a door of curiousity that you may not
have known you had.

"Think of your windshield as an energy source for your brain"

Use pictures and video to assist as well! Bookmark Youtube videos and
watch prior to practicing!
