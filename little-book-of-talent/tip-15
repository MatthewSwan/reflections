Break problems down into their smalest forms. It is almost impossible to
solve a complex problem without solving bits and pieces at a time. When
programming, if you try to solve the entire problem in your head, you will
most certainly be stuck for hours on end. If you break the problem down into
segments that you can understand, the problem becomes a puzzle of pieces.
Hopefully, you know how to solve each of these piece and are able to put the entire
thing together at the end. Solve the little pieces you know and worry about putting
everything together once all the little pieces are solved.
