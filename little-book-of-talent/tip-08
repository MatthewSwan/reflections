Deveoping hard skills is all about practice. Repitition is the key here. If you make a mistake,
you will want to understand why you made that mistake to avoid it in the future. You want to make
sure that you are putting correct methods in your memory cache. Learning to do something the
wrong way will not help you in the long run. Even after you master a certain skill, you may have to
 practice to keep you're certain mastery skill up.

Mastering the basic skills of something is essential to moving on to bigger problems. The larger
problems will seem daunting if you do not have the basic skills to get you through them. It is very important
to not jump into the 'deep end' and you master skills bit by bit. This will allow you to excel in later stages
of your progression.
