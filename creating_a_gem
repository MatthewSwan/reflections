gems are libraries that we get from Rubygems. We need them because
some libraries don't come with ruby.

The gitloc program will take a git repo  and tell the user how many
lines of code it has.

We started by making the code exacutable. We then wanted it to run without
explicitly stating ruby. This is done by placing a 'shebang' at the top
of the code '#!usr/bin/env ruby'

The env is in the shebang because the ruby executable is consistent on
each computer. This allows the gem to be located at various spots on
other individual's computers. It will consistently look in /usr/bin/env
for the ruby executable.
