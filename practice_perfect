======== Rule 17 ============
Make Models Believable

People like to see things actually work. Often, we are not convinced something
will actually work until we see it in person.

Comparison - a novice baker may burn everything they bake until they see someone
do it properly. After that, they will most likely 'borrow' concepts that the
experienced baker used.

SEEING IS BELIEVING!!!!!!!!

I'll compare this to our test driven development. The acceptance test is a type of
model for us to create programs off of. We know what we need in our programs before
we worry about the how.

This is reverse thinking for many of us and will take some practice. However,
when we see it work and the programs run, it puts belief in our minds that this
is a good way to go when writing programs.

Model in a context similar to what learners are trying to perform. This allows students
to makes sense and believe that the model's  methods actually work.
