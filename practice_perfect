======== Rule 6 ============
Practice "Bright Spots"

Practicing skills over and over allows all us to develop skills that we previously didn't have.
Many think that practicing is for individuals that need to become better at something,
and that is often the case. However, those that are highly proficient in their skill still need
to spend time practicing also. This segment of practice is actually very powerful.

'Bright Spots' - often overlooked skills

There are benefits to concentrating on the things that you are really good at. Practicing these can
in turn, start to make the things you aren't very good at, better.

  * You may be extremely good at coding and coding more will improve your typing skills

Don't dwell on every weakness but instead maximize your strengths. Make strengths override weaknesses.

Practicing can be even more effective when doing it in a team format. One person's strengths can be
another person's weakness and vice versa. This could allow partners to help each other concurrently.

Try varying up your practice to keep you on your toes. Try changing a few things in the waypoints to
give you a new practice model. Keep track of what you well and reflect on it. Tweak a few things and
see if your performance stays on par.
