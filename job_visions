I want to be a proficient programmer. Not only a programmer, but
I would like to begin building a network of individuals within the
the tech industry to gain information from.

I would ultimately like to work at a financial company in the
tech department. Possibly data analysis or algorithm writing.
I always wanted to work within financial markets. Tech at a given
bank would be ideal.

Building automated trading systems
Building platforms for clients doing automated trading
Building tools for human-driven trading
building risk analysis tools for trading platforms
Ultimately becoming a trader would be a possible goal of mine.
